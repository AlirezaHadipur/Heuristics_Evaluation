# Nielsen's ten Heuristic Evaluation

## Introduction ðŸ“¢

After learning data science, I enrolled in the UX Research and Design Principles course from the University of Michigan on Coursera. Inspired by a project from the course, I undertook my own project to evaluate Nielsen's ten heuristics across different platforms: a web page, a mobile application, and a physical object.

## Tools and Course ðŸ› âš’

This project was guided by the principles and methodologies taught in the UX Research and Design Principles course from the University of Michigan on Coursera. The primary tools and techniques used in this project include:

- Heuristic Evaluation: Based on Nielsen's ten usability heuristics.
- Prototyping Tools: Such as Figma or Sketch for creating and testing web and mobile interfaces.
- Survey and Feedback Tools: Google Forms or similar for gathering user feedback.

## What I Learned ðŸ“š

Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of several key aspects of UX research and design, including:

- UX Research and Design Principles: Gaining practical experience in applying foundational concepts from my Coursera course.
- Nielsen's Heuristic Evaluation: Understanding and applying the ten usability heuristics to evaluate user interfaces.
- Goal of Execution and Evaluation: Learning the importance of setting clear objectives for usability studies and accurately assessing their outcomes.
- Human-Computer Interaction: Insights into how humans think and act when interacting with digital and physical products.
- User-Centered Design: Emphasizing the necessity of designing with the user in mind to create intuitive and effective solutions.

## Conclusion ðŸ“•

This project provided valuable insights into the application of Nielsen's ten heuristics across different platforms. Evaluating a web page, a mobile application, and a physical object highlighted the versatility and importance of these heuristics in improving user experience. The findings underscore the necessity of continuous usability testing and iteration to create intuitive and user-friendly designs.
